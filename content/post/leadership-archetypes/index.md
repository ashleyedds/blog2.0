Disclaimer: No one described in the following post is anyone I currently work with. Everyone in this post is someone that I deeply respect and, should you find yourself suspicious that one of these charactures may be in reference to you, know that they are, indeed, characatures and that you are more than this distilled version I crafted for the sake of storytelling.

In my six total years working in tech, I've worked under four managers and worked either directly or indirectly under six directors/VPs/SVPs. They all had incredibly different styles of leadership and approaches to coaching and mentorship, so I've seen a lot of really great things, and a lot of really not-so-great things. Reflecting back on some of my former leaders, it's intersting to see how they fall into certain archetypes pretty cleanly. And taking closer examination of this distilling down of character that always happens as time passes and detialed memory fades, has given me some takeaways that I hope to apply to my personal leadership style.

Archetype 1: The Torchbearer
_You never had to guess what they cared about—it radiated off of them like heat from an open flame._
This leader led with passion, their emotions fueling everything they did. When they believed in something, they really believed in it, and that kind of intensity could be inspiring—but also volatile. 

Archetype 2: The Sentinel
If there was a hill to die on, they had already fortified it.
This was the manager who saw themselves as the last line of defense for their team, fighting battles that weren’t always visible but were deeply felt. Their protectiveness could make you feel safe—but also, at times, like they were shielding you from things you needed to see for yourself.

Archetype 3: The Aloof Guru
They had wisdom to share—if only you could catch them long enough to hear it.
This manager had a way of making you feel like every interaction was a puzzle you had to solve. They weren’t overly present, but when they did offer guidance, it was often insightful—if frustratingly vague.

Archetype 4: The Ferris Bueller
Rules? Structure? That’s for other people.
This manager thrived on charisma, getting by on charm and quick thinking rather than meticulous planning. They made work fun, but sometimes at the cost of clarity and accountability.

Funny enough, all of my leadership thus far has been male...
