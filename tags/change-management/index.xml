Like many of you, I&amp;rsquo;ve been navigating significant changes at work—a reorganization that&amp;rsquo;s shifted reporting structures, changed project ownership, and required a lot of processing. It&amp;rsquo;s been a period of reflection, adjustment, and growth. And through it all, I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking deeply about what it means to be an effective change agent as a leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change management is hard. Let&amp;rsquo;s just acknowledge that upfront. People are naturally change-averse, and for good reason. Change brings uncertainty, fear of the unknown, and worries about whether we&amp;rsquo;ll thrive in the &amp;ldquo;new normal&amp;rdquo; the way we did before. Sometimes we&amp;rsquo;re simply comfortable where we are and don&amp;rsquo;t want to move. That resistance isn&amp;rsquo;t irrational—it&amp;rsquo;s human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m fortunate that Relias provided dedicated change management training to leadership last year, and I&amp;rsquo;ve drawn heavily on those lessons during this reorganization. I&amp;rsquo;ve also witnessed what happens when change management goes wrong. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen changes fumbled with conflicting communication and gaps in handoffs. I&amp;rsquo;ve watched leaders actively oppose the changes they&amp;rsquo;re supposed to implement—leaving their teams demoralized and confused about how to proceed when their own leader isn&amp;rsquo;t on board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through both the training and my lived experience, two principles have emerged as absolutely critical: &lt;strong&gt;disagree and commit&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;being prepared to show up for your team first and foremost&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-power-of-disagree-and-commit"&gt;The Power of &amp;ldquo;Disagree and Commit&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I first heard the phrase &amp;ldquo;disagree and commit,&amp;rdquo; I thought it was ridiculous. It felt disingenuous. How could I champion something I fundamentally disagreed with? Didn&amp;rsquo;t that violate the principles of servant leadership and transparency?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when I found myself facing a change I didn&amp;rsquo;t agree with, the concept suddenly clicked. Here&amp;rsquo;s the reality: I&amp;rsquo;m not a CEO. I&amp;rsquo;m not running the business. I don&amp;rsquo;t have the comprehensive, high-level view required to understand all the factors driving certain decisions. We have to trust that our leaders are making decisions that serve the broader organizational good, even when those decisions don&amp;rsquo;t make sense from our limited vantage point or might negatively impact our day-to-day work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the framework I&amp;rsquo;ve developed for working through &amp;ldquo;disagree and commit&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand and process your disagreement.&lt;/strong&gt; Give yourself space to feel your feelings and identify specific friction points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engage in dialogue.&lt;/strong&gt; Take those concerns to your boss or peer leadership group in a small setting. Seek to understand the broader business context behind the decision. Ask questions. Listen actively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Craft your narrative.&lt;/strong&gt; Use that expanded understanding to develop how you&amp;rsquo;ll support your team through the change, especially around the concerns you initially had—because your team will likely have those same concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support, acknowledge, and affirm.&lt;/strong&gt; Show up consistently for your team. Validate their concerns while maintaining alignment with the organizational direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leadership alignment in messaging is crucial. There&amp;rsquo;s also an important nuance around transparency—what you can and can&amp;rsquo;t share. Some teams benefit from hearing your journey from initial disagreement to commitment. Other teams interpret any hint of concern as a sign that disaster is imminent. You have to know your team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I&amp;rsquo;ve had to ask myself: who am I to declare this decision is wrong? That it will lead to bad outcomes? I don&amp;rsquo;t have all the information or the experience to make that call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="showing-up-for-your-team"&gt;Showing Up for Your Team
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being there for your team requires navigating two distinct scenarios, each with its own challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario One: You know about the change in advance.&lt;/strong&gt; This is ideal for planning and crafting a thoughtful transition strategy with aligned messaging across leadership. You can close gaps and coordinate handoffs. But it&amp;rsquo;s incredibly difficult to hold confidential information that affects people&amp;rsquo;s lives and work without being able to share it. I understand why confidentiality is necessary, but it tugs at my heartstrings every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario Two: You learn about the change at the same time as your team.&lt;/strong&gt; This requires managing your own uncertainty while simultaneously supporting others. You have to be comfortable answering questions with partial information or admitting you don&amp;rsquo;t know something. It&amp;rsquo;s critical to avoid filling knowledge gaps with speculation or making false promises to ease concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both scenarios, self-awareness is essential. Know yourself well enough to recognize when you need time to process before you can be fully present for your team. It&amp;rsquo;s okay to say, &amp;ldquo;I need to sit with this, and then we&amp;rsquo;ll regroup.&amp;rdquo; Your team needs you to show up grounded, not reactive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-ongoing-journey"&gt;The Ongoing Journey
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Change management isn&amp;rsquo;t a skill you master once and then file away. It&amp;rsquo;s an ongoing practice that requires emotional intelligence, strategic thinking, and genuine care for the people you lead. As I continue navigating this reorganization, I&amp;rsquo;m reminded daily that our role as leaders isn&amp;rsquo;t to shield our teams from all change—it&amp;rsquo;s to guide them through it with honesty, empathy, and unwavering support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes aren&amp;rsquo;t over. They never really are. But I&amp;rsquo;m learning to be a better change agent with each challenge, and I hope these reflections help you do the same.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Mindful Curiosity</title><link>https://ashleyedds.dev/p/mindful-curiosity/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ashleyedds.dev/p/mindful-curiosity/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://ashleyedds.dev/p/mindful-curiosity/cover.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Mindful Curiosity" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my most recent coaching session, I sought guidance on an upcoming meeting with my management colleagues, directors, and SVP. I was nervous because I had received information about a change I didn’t agree with—one that I believed would significantly impact my team. &lt;em&gt;(It turned out my concerns were based on a misunderstanding, and my anxiety was unnecessary.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I explained my concerns, the questions I had, and my apprehension about how &amp;ldquo;pushing back&amp;rdquo; might be perceived, my coach interrupted with a thought-provoking question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do you think you&amp;rsquo;re pushing back? What I hear is your curiosity about the change and a desire to understand where it’s coming from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That question completely reframed my perspective. Why did I instinctively view my desire to understand leadership decisions as resistance? Shouldn’t gathering context and reasoning be part of my role as an effective change agent for my team? Isn’t deeper understanding essential for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensuring I have the right information before expressing concerns?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Framing concerns in a productive and constructive way?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This internalized fear of questioning leadership likely stems from deep-seated patterns in my psychology—an exploration for another time. But recognizing this mindset allows me to be more mindful in leadership interactions. Moving forward, when I feel anxiety creeping in, I’ll pause and ask myself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I feeling anxious because I’m mislabeling my curiosity as pushback?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="strengthening-my-curiosity-muscle"&gt;Strengthening My Curiosity Muscle
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since this realization, I’ve also noticed other ways my curiosity (or lack thereof) manifests. Sometimes, I accept information or suggestions at face value without deeper exploration. If I want to continue growing as a technical leader, I need to challenge myself to dig deeper and ensure I have a well-rounded understanding before making decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="my-commitment-to-mindful-curiosity"&gt;My Commitment to Mindful Curiosity
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To foster this growth, I’m setting the following personal challenges:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reframing curiosity&lt;/strong&gt; – Asking leadership questions to understand a decision isn’t an act of defiance; it’s a tool for learning, effective communication, and advocacy for my team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seeking deeper understanding&lt;/strong&gt; – Instead of passively accepting information, I’ll actively engage, research, and explore different perspectives to develop a more informed viewpoint.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiosity isn’t resistance—it’s a leadership strength. If I can embrace this mindset, I’ll not only become a stronger advocate for my team but also continue evolving as a leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about you?&lt;/strong&gt; Have you ever mistaken curiosity for pushback? How do you challenge yourself to ask better questions and seek deeper understanding?

Learning to Embrace Change in Process Overhaul" /&gt;&lt;h2 id="update-2325"&gt;Update 2/3/25
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since publishing this article, it has been brought to my attention that the &amp;ldquo;missing cheese&amp;rdquo; metaphor my colleague used, and I assumed an off-the-cuff-original, is actually likely referencing &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0091876044?ref=cm_sw_r_ffobk_cso_cp_apin_dp_X47H5QMN1BPD16XBKCC9&amp;amp;ref_=cm_sw_r_ffobk_cso_cp_apin_dp_X47H5QMN1BPD16XBKCC9&amp;amp;social_share=cm_sw_r_ffobk_cso_cp_apin_dp_X47H5QMN1BPD16XBKCC9&amp;amp;starsLeft=1&amp;amp;skipTwisterOG=1&amp;amp;bestFormat=true&amp;amp;titleSource=avft-a&amp;amp;newOGT=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who Moved My Cheese&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Dr. Spencer Johnston. I shall be adding this to my TBR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I received an incredible compliment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m really looking for your steady presence in this to really drive &amp;lsquo;Is this actually broken? Or is your cheese just missing?&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This simple remark made my day and sparked some deep reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, we overhauled our Jira project management workflows, starting fresh with a simpler, more streamlined strategy. The goal? Cut down on complexity to make our sprints more effective and reduce administrative overhead. We removed redundant workflow statuses—like tracking deployment and verification—and simplified the movement of tasks on the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite detailed pre-communication, training, and preparation, the change wasn’t universally welcomed. Which is fine. Pleasing everyone is impossible and change is tough. Within a week, the change management Teams channel lit up with frustrations, particularly around the removal of the &amp;ldquo;Ready for Testing&amp;rdquo; status—a step where tickets lingered until a test engineer was available to pick them up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some, the absence of this status felt like a loss of control. To them, their &amp;ldquo;cheese was missing,&amp;rdquo; but it felt like something was actually broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When discussions in the channel veered toward resistance rather than solutions, I sent a message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m hearing &amp;rsquo;this thing doesn&amp;rsquo;t work like it did before&amp;rsquo;—and that&amp;rsquo;s kind of the point. The first couple of sprints may have growing pains, but we owe it to the people who spent time designing this to see if it works as intended. We want to hear feedback, but let’s give it a little time before making big changes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, I felt anxious after hitting send. Pushing back publicly wasn’t in my comfort zone. But the response—a trio of heart emojis from process designers and positive feedback from project leads in a private DM—was reaffirming. They appreciated that I stood firm, giving the new workflow the time and space to succeed before yielding to reactionary changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I later offered office hours to help teams adapt to the new process. While there weren’t many takers, it signaled to me that teams were finding ways to work through the adjustment. Now, as we enter Sprint 2, I’m eager to evaluate pain points after completing Sprint 3 and ensure the process is genuinely serving its purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What stood out most to me was how this moment taught me something about myself. By holding boundaries and embracing discomfort, I discovered a steadying presence I hadn’t fully recognized until I received that comment in passing today. It’s a trait I’ll nurture, as it not only supports me but also adds value to my teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day change can feel unsettling—but sometimes missing cheese just means it’s time to find a new snack. 😉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you ever experienced “missing cheese” in your workflows or team processes? Share your thoughts in the comments! How do you balance patience with addressing feedback during times of change?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
