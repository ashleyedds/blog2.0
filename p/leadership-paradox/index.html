<time class=article-time--reading>5 minute read</time></div></footer></div></header><section class=article-content><p>As leaders, we&rsquo;re often taught that emotional control is paramount. We learn to stay calm under pressure, think before we speak, and approach every situation with level-headed rationality. But what if this approach—while valuable—is missing a crucial component of effective leadership?</p><h2 id=the-feedback-that-changed-everything>The Feedback That Changed Everything</h2><p>During my participation in a leadership accelerator program at Relias, I received feedback that fundamentally challenged how I viewed effective leadership. The comprehensive assessment revealed something I hadn&rsquo;t considered: my pride in remaining emotionally detached might actually be limiting my effectiveness as a leader.</p><p>The conversation involved a leader I deeply respect—someone whose approach differs completely from mine yet achieves remarkable results. Through our discussion with a facilitator from our parent company, an uncomfortable truth emerged about my leadership style.</p><h2 id=my-default-leadership-response>My Default Leadership Response</h2><p>For years, I&rsquo;ve operated under a specific framework when facing challenging situations or feeling upset:</p><ol><li>Remove myself from the immediate situation</li><li>Process emotions privately until I feel calm and level-headed</li><li>Return to address the issue without emotional involvement</li><li>Focus on constructive, forward-moving solutions</li></ol><p>This approach felt rational, professional, and respectful. It aligned with my personal values and seemed to avoid the pitfalls of reactive, emotion-driven communication that I&rsquo;d witnessed create problems in other contexts.</p><h2 id=the-surprising-truth-about-leadership-communication>The Surprising Truth About Leadership Communication</h2><p>The feedback I received was both simple and profound: <strong>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s important as a leader that you sometimes let people know that you are unhappy with them.&rdquo;</strong></p><p>This statement struck me like lightning because it ran completely counter to my self-image as a leader. I had spent considerable effort developing systems to avoid communicating emotionally, believing this made me more effective and professional.</p><h2 id=why-emotional-detachment-can-backfire>Why Emotional Detachment Can Backfire</h2><p>What I learned through this experience is that my well-intentioned approach was creating an unintended consequence. By removing all emotion from my communication, I was inadvertently:</p><ul><li><strong>Downplaying the severity of situations</strong> that warranted concern</li><li><strong>Depriving team members of important contextual information</strong> about the impact of their actions</li><li><strong>Missing opportunities for immediate course correction</strong> through emotional feedback</li><li><strong>Reducing the motivational impact</strong> of my leadership communication</li></ul><h2 id=the-strategic-value-of-showing-unhappiness>The Strategic Value of Showing Unhappiness</h2><p>The revelation helped me understand that a leader&rsquo;s unhappiness with a situation serves multiple strategic purposes:</p><h3 id=immediate-signal-strength>Immediate Signal Strength</h3><p>When team members see that their leader is genuinely upset about an outcome, it immediately communicates the gravity of the situation in ways that calm, rational feedback cannot.</p><h3 id=creating-coachable-moments>Creating Coachable Moments</h3><p>That moment when someone thinks, &ldquo;Oh no, my boss is upset with me because of this&rdquo; becomes a powerful catalyst for self-reflection and behavioral change.</p><h3 id=authentic-relationship-building>Authentic Relationship Building</h3><p>Showing genuine emotion (when appropriate) demonstrates that you&rsquo;re invested in outcomes and care deeply about the team&rsquo;s success.</p><h3 id=clear-expectation-setting>Clear Expectation Setting</h3><p>Your emotional response helps team members calibrate their understanding of what matters most and what standards they&rsquo;re expected to meet.</p><h2 id=the-two-phase-leadership-approach>The Two-Phase Leadership Approach</h2><p>The key insight wasn&rsquo;t to abandon my thoughtful, rational approach entirely, but rather to implement a two-phase strategy:</p><h3 id=phase-1-immediate-emotional-feedback>Phase 1: Immediate Emotional Feedback</h3><p>Allow team members to witness and understand your genuine reaction to situations when they occur. This provides immediate context and impact.</p><h3 id=phase-2-reflective-problem-solving>Phase 2: Reflective Problem-Solving</h3><p>Later, when emotions have settled, engage in the deeper, analytical conversation about what happened and how to improve moving forward.</p><h2 id=balancing-emotional-intelligence-with-authentic-leadership>Balancing Emotional Intelligence with Authentic Leadership</h2><p>This experience taught me that effective leadership isn&rsquo;t about eliminating emotion—it&rsquo;s about using emotion strategically. The goal isn&rsquo;t to become reactive or lose professional composure, but rather to ensure that the full picture of your leadership perspective is communicated.</p><p>Your frustration, disappointment, or concern about a situation is itself valuable information for your team. It helps them understand not just what went wrong, but how significantly it impacted the broader goals and relationships they care about.</p><h2 id=implementing-constructive-emotional-leadership>Implementing Constructive Emotional Leadership</h2><p>If you&rsquo;re like me and tend toward emotional restraint in leadership situations, consider these strategies:</p><p><strong>Allow Initial Reactions:</strong> Give yourself permission to show genuine concern or disappointment when it first occurs, rather than immediately suppressing it.</p><p><strong>Use Emotion as Data:</strong> Treat your emotional responses as valuable information to share with your team about priorities and expectations.</p><p><strong>Follow Up Thoughtfully:</strong> Maintain your commitment to reflective, solution-oriented conversations, but don&rsquo;t let them replace the immediate emotional feedback.</p><p><strong>Model Emotional Intelligence:</strong> Show your team that emotions can be acknowledged and expressed professionally without derailing productive communication.</p><h2 id=the-leadership-growth-mindset>The Leadership Growth Mindset</h2><p>Perhaps the most valuable aspect of this feedback was how it challenged my assumptions about what makes a &ldquo;good&rdquo; leader. Growth in leadership often requires us to examine our comfortable patterns and consider whether they&rsquo;re serving our teams as effectively as we believe.</p><p>The leader who gave me this feedback approaches leadership completely differently than I do, yet achieves incredible results. This experience reminded me that there&rsquo;s no single template for effective leadership—but there are always opportunities to expand our toolkit.</p><h2 id=moving-forward-emotion-as-leadership-tool>Moving Forward: Emotion as Leadership Tool</h2><p>Today, I&rsquo;m still the same person who values thoughtful, rational problem-solving. But I&rsquo;ve added a new dimension to my leadership approach: the strategic use of authentic emotional communication.</p><p>When something goes wrong now, I don&rsquo;t hide my disappointment. I let my team see that I&rsquo;m genuinely upset about the outcome, because that unhappiness is part of the feedback they need to fully understand the situation and grow from it.</p><p>The goal isn&rsquo;t to become more emotional as a leader—it&rsquo;s to become more complete in how we communicate the full spectrum of our leadership perspective.</p><hr><p><em>What surprising feedback have you received that changed your approach to leadership? How do you balance emotional authenticity with professional communication in your role?</em></p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a href=/tags/leadership-lessons/>Leadership Lessons</a>
